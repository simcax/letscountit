# Let's Count It!
A project to count things. Let it be how many days in a row you did that special thing, or if you are on target with the number of Kilometers run this quarter - we want to count it and let you keep track of your goal.

## Fun and easy
It should be fun! Not a bad conscience :-) And then it has to be easy! Go to the website and click that thing you do or maybe only go there on that dreaded day, where your streak ended? We'll see what we come up with.
